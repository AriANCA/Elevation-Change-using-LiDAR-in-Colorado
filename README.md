# Elevation Change using LiDAR in Colorado
Measure Changes in the Terrain Caused by a Flood Using Lidar Data
# Introduction


# Data 
The data to create DTMs to analyze landscape change due to the Colorado floods was downloaded directly from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), however for practical purposes it is located in the data folder. 
The first DTM preDTM3.tif is a model from data collected 26-27 June 2013 and the postDTM3.tif is a model from data collected on 8 October 2013, the units are in meters for both rasters.

# Results and Discussion
Hillshade layers are models created to add visual depth to maps. It represents what the terrain would look like in shadow with the sun at a specific azimuth. The default azimuth for many hillshades is 315 degrees. This model was used in Colflood.R 
The Digital Terrain Model (DTM) shown below was created for the lower Four-Mile Canyon Creek area in Boulder, Colorado using data collected before and after the 2013 floods. These maps show subtle differences in elevation.
